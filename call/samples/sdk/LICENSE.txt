agent-base
==========
### Turn a function into an [`http.Agent`][http.Agent] instance
[![Build Status](https://github.com/TooTallNate/node-agent-base/workflows/Node%20CI/badge.svg)](https://github.com/TooTallNate/node-agent-base/actions?workflow=Node+CI)

This module provides an `http.Agent` generator. That is, you pass it an async
callback function, and it returns a new `http.Agent` instance that will invoke the
given callback function when sending outbound HTTP requests.

#### Some subclasses:

Here's some more interesting uses of `agent-base`.
Send a pull request to list yours!

 * [`http-proxy-agent`][http-proxy-agent]: An HTTP(s) proxy `http.Agent` implementation for HTTP endpoints
 * [`https-proxy-agent`][https-proxy-agent]: An HTTP(s) proxy `http.Agent` implementation for HTTPS endpoints
 * [`pac-proxy-agent`][pac-proxy-agent]: A PAC file proxy `http.Agent` implementation for HTTP and HTTPS
 * [`socks-proxy-agent`][socks-proxy-agent]: A SOCKS proxy `http.Agent` implementation for HTTP and HTTPS


Installation
------------

Install with `npm`:

``` bash
$ npm install agent-base
```


Example
-------

Here's a minimal example that creates a new `net.Socket` connection to the server
for every HTTP request (i.e. the equivalent of `agent: false` option):

```js
var net = require('net');
var tls = require('tls');
var url = require('url');
var http = require('http');
var agent = require('agent-base');

var endpoint = 'http://nodejs.org/api/';
var parsed = url.parse(endpoint);

// This is the important part!
parsed.agent = agent(function (req, opts) {
  var socket;
  // `secureEndpoint` is true when using the https module
  if (opts.secureEndpoint) {
    socket = tls.connect(opts);
  } else {
    socket = net.connect(opts);
  }
  return socket;
});

// Everything else works just like normal...
http.get(parsed, function (res) {
  console.log('"response" event!', res.headers);
  res.pipe(process.stdout);
});
```

Returning a Promise or using an `async` function is also supported:

```js
agent(async function (req, opts) {
  await sleep(1000);
  // etc…
});
```

Return another `http.Agent` instance to "pass through" the responsibility
for that HTTP request to that agent:

```js
agent(function (req, opts) {
  return opts.secureEndpoint ? https.globalAgent : http.globalAgent;
});
```


API
---

## Agent(Function callback[, Object options]) → [http.Agent][]

Creates a base `http.Agent` that will execute the callback function `callback`
for every HTTP request that it is used as the `agent` for. The callback function
is responsible for creating a `stream.Duplex` instance of some kind that will be
used as the underlying socket in the HTTP request.

The `options` object accepts the following properties:

  * `timeout` - Number - Timeout for the `callback()` function in milliseconds. Defaults to Infinity (optional).

The callback function should have the following signature:

### callback(http.ClientRequest req, Object options, Function cb) → undefined

The ClientRequest `req` can be accessed to read request headers and
and the path, etc. The `options` object contains the options passed
to the `http.request()`/`https.request()` function call, and is formatted
to be directly passed to `net.connect()`/`tls.connect()`, or however
else you want a Socket to be created. Pass the created socket to
the callback function `cb` once created, and the HTTP request will
continue to proceed.

If the `https` module is used to invoke the HTTP request, then the
`secureEndpoint` property on `options` _will be set to `true`_.

The Node.js's missing `keep alive` `http.Agent`. Support `http` and `https`.

## What's different from original `http.Agent`?

- `keepAlive=true` by default
- Disable Nagle's algorithm: `socket.setNoDelay(true)`
- Add free socket timeout: avoid long time inactivity socket leak in the free-sockets queue.
- Add active socket timeout: avoid long time inactivity socket leak in the active-sockets queue.

## Install

```bash
$ npm install agentkeepalive --save
```

## new Agent([options])

* `options` {Object} Set of configurable options to set on the agent.
  Can have the following fields:
  * `keepAlive` {Boolean} Keep sockets around in a pool to be used by
    other requests in the future. Default = `true`.
  * `keepAliveMsecs` {Number} When using the keepAlive option, specifies the initial delay
    for TCP Keep-Alive packets. Ignored when the keepAlive option is false or undefined. Defaults to 1000.
    Default = `1000`.  Only relevant if `keepAlive` is set to `true`.
  * `freeSocketKeepAliveTimeout`: {Number} Sets the free socket to timeout
    after `freeSocketKeepAliveTimeout` milliseconds of inactivity on the free socket.
    Default is `15000`.
    Only relevant if `keepAlive` is set to `true`.
  * `timeout`: {Number} Sets the working socket to timeout
    after `timeout` milliseconds of inactivity on the working socket.
    Default is `freeSocketKeepAliveTimeout * 2`.
  * `maxSockets` {Number} Maximum number of sockets to allow per
    host. Default = `Infinity`.
  * `maxFreeSockets` {Number} Maximum number of sockets (per host) to leave open
    in a free state. Only relevant if `keepAlive` is set to `true`.
    Default = `256`.
  * `socketActiveTTL` {Number} Sets the socket active time to live, even if it's in use.
    If not setted the behaviour continues the same (the socket will be released only when free)
    Default = `null`.

## Usage

```js
const http = require('http');
const Agent = require('agentkeepalive');

const keepaliveAgent = new Agent({
  maxSockets: 100,
  maxFreeSockets: 10,
  timeout: 60000,
  freeSocketKeepAliveTimeout: 30000, // free socket keepalive for 30 seconds
});

const options = {
  host: 'cnodejs.org',
  port: 80,
  path: '/',
  method: 'GET',
  agent: keepaliveAgent,
};

const req = http.request(options, res => {
  console.log('STATUS: ' + res.statusCode);
  console.log('HEADERS: ' + JSON.stringify(res.headers));
  res.setEncoding('utf8');
  res.on('data', function (chunk) {
    console.log('BODY: ' + chunk);
  });
});
req.on('error', e => {
  console.log('problem with request: ' + e.message);
});
req.end();

setTimeout(() => {
  if (keepaliveAgent.statusChanged) {
    console.log('[%s] agent status changed: %j', Date(), keepaliveAgent.getCurrentStatus());
  }
}, 2000);

```

### `getter agent.statusChanged`

counters have change or not after last checkpoint.

### `agent.getCurrentStatus()`

`agent.getCurrentStatus()` will return a object to show the status of this agent:

```js
{
  createSocketCount: 10,
  closeSocketCount: 5,
  timeoutSocketCount: 0,
  requestCount: 5,
  freeSockets: { 'localhost:57479:': 3 },
  sockets: { 'localhost:57479:': 5 },
  requests: {}
}
```

### Support `https`

```js
const https = require('https');
const HttpsAgent = require('agentkeepalive').HttpsAgent;

const keepaliveAgent = new HttpsAgent();
// https://www.google.com/search?q=nodejs&sugexp=chrome,mod=12&sourceid=chrome&ie=UTF-8
const options = {
  host: 'www.google.com',
  port: 443,
  path: '/search?q=nodejs&sugexp=chrome,mod=12&sourceid=chrome&ie=UTF-8',
  method: 'GET',
  agent: keepaliveAgent,
};

const req = https.request(options, res => {
  console.log('STATUS: ' + res.statusCode);
  console.log('HEADERS: ' + JSON.stringify(res.headers));
  res.setEncoding('utf8');
  res.on('data', chunk => {
    console.log('BODY: ' + chunk);
  });
});

req.on('error', e => {
  console.log('problem with request: ' + e.message);
});
req.end();

setTimeout(() => {
  console.log('agent status: %j', keepaliveAgent.getCurrentStatus());
}, 2000);
```

data-uri-to-buffer
==================
### Generate a Buffer instance from a [Data URI][rfc] string
[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/TooTallNate/node-data-uri-to-buffer.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/TooTallNate/node-data-uri-to-buffer)

This module accepts a ["data" URI][rfc] String of data, and returns a
node.js `Buffer` instance with the decoded data.


Installation
------------

Install with `npm`:

``` bash
$ npm install data-uri-to-buffer
```


Example
-------

``` js
var dataUriToBuffer = require('data-uri-to-buffer');

// plain-text data is supported
var uri = 'data:,Hello%2C%20World!';
var decoded = dataUriToBuffer(uri);
console.log(decoded.toString());
// 'Hello, World!'

// base64-encoded data is supported
uri = 'data:text/plain;base64,SGVsbG8sIFdvcmxkIQ%3D%3D';
decoded = dataUriToBuffer(uri);
console.log(decoded.toString());
// 'Hello, World!'
```


API
---

### dataUriToBuffer(String uri) → Buffer

The `type` property on the Buffer instance gets set to the main type portion of
the "mediatype" portion of the "data" URI, or defaults to `"text/plain"` if not
specified.

The `typeFull` property on the Buffer instance gets set to the entire
"mediatype" portion of the "data" URI (including all parameters), or defaults
to `"text/plain;charset=US-ASCII"` if not specified.

The `charset` property on the Buffer instance gets set to the Charset portion of
the "mediatype" portion of the "data" URI, or defaults to `"US-ASCII"` if the
entire type is not specified, or defaults to `""` otherwise.

*Note*: If the only the main type is specified but not the charset, e.g.
`"data:text/plain,abc"`, the charset is set to the empty string. The spec only
defaults to US-ASCII as charset if the entire type is not specified.

degenerator
===========
### Compiles sync functions into async functions
[![Build Status](https://github.com/TooTallNate/node-degenerator/workflows/Node%20CI/badge.svg)](https://github.com/TooTallNate/node-degenerator/actions?workflow=Node+CI)

Sometimes you need to write sync looking code that's really async under the hood.
This module takes a String to one or more synchronous JavaScript functions, and
returns a new String that with those JS functions transpiled into `async`
functions.

So this:

```js
function foo() {
  return a('bar') || b();
}
```

Gets compiled into:

```js
async function foo() {
    return await a('bar') || await b();
}
```

With the compiled output code, you can evaluate the code using the `vm` module
in Node.js, or save the code to a file and require it, or whatever.


Installation
------------

Install with `npm`:

```bash
$ npm install degenerator
```


Example
-------

You must explicitly specify the names of the functions that should be
"asyncified". So say we wanted to expose a `get(url)` function that did
and HTTP request and returned the response body.

The user has provided us with this implementation:

``` js
function myFn() {
  const one = get('https://google.com');
  const two = get('http://nodejs.org');
  const three = JSON.parse(get('http://jsonip.org'));
  return [one, two, three];
}
```

Now we can compile this into an asyncronous function, implement the
async `get()` function, and finally evaluate it into a real JavaScript function
instance with the `vm` module:


```typescript
import vm from 'vm';
import degenerator from 'degenerator';

// The `get()` function is Promise-based (error handling omitted for brevity)
function get(endpoint: string) {
  return new Promise((resolve, reject) => {
    var mod = 0 == endpoint.indexOf('https:') ? require('https') : require('http');
    var req = mod.get(endpoint);
    req.on('response', function (res) {
      var data = '';
      res.setEncoding('utf8');
      res.on('data', function (b) { data += b; });
      res.on('end', function () {
        resolve(data);
      });
    });
  });
}

// Convert the JavaScript string provided from the user (assumed to be `str` var)
str = degenerator(str, [ 'get' ]);

// Turn the JS String into a real async function instance
const asyncFn = vm.runInNewContext(`(${str})`, { get });

// Now we can invoke the function asynchronously
asyncFn().then((res) => {
  // Do something with `res`...
});
```


API
---

### degenerator(code: string, names: Array<string|RegExp>, options?: DegeneratorOptions): String

Returns a "degeneratorified" JavaScript string, with `async`/`await` transplanted.

#### DegeneratorOptions

An options object _may_ be passed in as the third parameter, with the following
values:

 * `output` - string - May be `"async"` or `"generator"`, defaults to `"async"`.

get-uri
=======
### Returns a `stream.Readable` from a URI string
[![Build Status](https://github.com/TooTallNate/node-get-uri/workflows/Node%20CI/badge.svg)](https://github.com/TooTallNate/node-get-uri/actions?workflow=Node+CI)

This high-level module accepts a URI string and returns a `Readable` stream
instance. There is built-in support for a variety of "protocols", and it's
easily extensible with more:

| Protocol  | Description                     | Example
|:---------:|:-------------------------------:|:---------------------------------:
| `data`    | [Data URIs][data]               | `data:text/plain;base64,SGVsbG8sIFdvcmxkIQ%3D%3D`
| `file`    | [File URIs][file]               | `file:///c:/windows/example.ini`
| `ftp`     | [FTP URIs][ftp]                 | `ftp://ftp.kernel.org/pub/site/README`
| `http`    | [HTTP URIs][http]               | `http://www.example.com/path/to/name`
| `https`   | [HTTPS URIs][https]             | `https://www.example.com/path/to/name`


Installation
------------

Install with `npm`:

``` bash
$ npm install get-uri
```


Example
-------

To simply get a `stream.Readable` instance from a `file:` URI, try something like:

``` js
var getUri = require('get-uri');

// `file:` maps to a `fs.ReadStream` instance…
getUri('file:///Users/nrajlich/wat.json', function (err, rs) {
  if (err) throw err;
  rs.pipe(process.stdout);
});
```


Missing Endpoints
-----------------

When you pass in a URI in which the resource referenced does not exist on the
destination server, then a `NotFoundError` will be returned. The `code` of the
error instance is set to `"ENOTFOUND"`, so you can special-case that in your code
to detect when a bad filename is requested:

``` js
getUri('http://example.com/resource.json', function (err, rs) {
  if (err) {
    if ('ENOTFOUND' == err.code) {
      // bad file path requested
    } else {
      // something else bad happened...
      throw err;
    }
  }

  // your app code…
});
```


Cacheability
------------

When calling `getUri()` with the same URI multiple times, the `get-uri` module
supports sending an indicator that the remote resource has not been modified
since the last time it has been retreived from that node process.

To do this, pass in a `cache` option to the "options object" argument
with the value set to the `stream.Readable` instance that was previously
returned. If the remote resource has not been changed since the last call for
that same URI, then a `NotModifiedError` instance will be returned with it's
`code` property set to `"ENOTMODIFIED"`.

When the `"ENOTMODIFIED"` error occurs, then you can safely re-use the
results from the previous `getUri()` call for that same URI:

``` js
// maps to a `fs.ReadStream` instance
getUri('http://example.com/resource.json', function (err, rs) {
  if (err) throw err;

  // … some time later, if you need to get this same URI again, pass in the
  // previous `stream.Readable` instance as `cache` option to potentially
  // receive an "ENOTMODIFIED" response:
  var opts = { cache: rs };
  getUri('http://example.com/resource.json', opts, function (err, rs2) {
    if (err) {
      if ('ENOTFOUND' == err.code) {
        // bad file path requested
      } else if ('ENOTMODIFIED' == err.code) {
        // source file has not been modified since last time it was requested,
        // so `rs2` is undefined and you are expected to re-use results from
        // a previous call to `getUri()`
      } else {
        // something else bad happened...
        throw err;
      }
    }
  });
});
```


API
---

### getUri(String uri[, Object options,] Function callback)

A `uri` String is required. An optional `options` object may be passed in:

 - `cache` - A `stream.Readable` instance from a previous call to `getUri()` with the same URI. If this option is passed in, and the destination endpoint has not been modified, then an `ENOTMODIFIED` error is returned

Any other options passed in to the `options` object will be passed through
to the low-level connection creation functions (`http.get()`, `ftp.connect()`,
etc).

Invokes the given `callback` function with a `stream.Readable` instance to
read the resource at the given `uri`.

The following NPM package may be included in this product:

 - https-proxy-agent@5.0.1

This package contains the following license and notice below:

https-proxy-agent
================
### An HTTP(s) proxy `http.Agent` implementation for HTTPS
[![Build Status](https://github.com/TooTallNate/node-https-proxy-agent/workflows/Node%20CI/badge.svg)](https://github.com/TooTallNate/node-https-proxy-agent/actions?workflow=Node+CI)

This module provides an `http.Agent` implementation that connects to a specified
HTTP or HTTPS proxy server, and can be used with the built-in `https` module.

Specifically, this `Agent` implementation connects to an intermediary "proxy"
server and issues the [CONNECT HTTP method][CONNECT], which tells the proxy to
open a direct TCP connection to the destination server.

Since this agent implements the CONNECT HTTP method, it also works with other
protocols that use this method when connecting over proxies (i.e. WebSockets).
See the "Examples" section below for more.


Installation
------------

Install with `npm`:

``` bash
$ npm install https-proxy-agent
```


Examples
--------

#### `https` module example

``` js
var url = require('url');
var https = require('https');
var HttpsProxyAgent = require('https-proxy-agent');

// HTTP/HTTPS proxy to connect to
var proxy = process.env.http_proxy || 'http://168.63.76.32:3128';
console.log('using proxy server %j', proxy);

// HTTPS endpoint for the proxy to connect to
var endpoint = process.argv[2] || 'https://graph.facebook.com/tootallnate';
console.log('attempting to GET %j', endpoint);
var options = url.parse(endpoint);

// create an instance of the `HttpsProxyAgent` class with the proxy server information
var agent = new HttpsProxyAgent(proxy);
options.agent = agent;

https.get(options, function (res) {
  console.log('"response" event!', res.headers);
  res.pipe(process.stdout);
});
```

#### `ws` WebSocket connection example

``` js
var url = require('url');
var WebSocket = require('ws');
var HttpsProxyAgent = require('https-proxy-agent');

// HTTP/HTTPS proxy to connect to
var proxy = process.env.http_proxy || 'http://168.63.76.32:3128';
console.log('using proxy server %j', proxy);

// WebSocket endpoint for the proxy to connect to
var endpoint = process.argv[2] || 'ws://echo.websocket.org';
var parsed = url.parse(endpoint);
console.log('attempting to connect to WebSocket %j', endpoint);

// create an instance of the `HttpsProxyAgent` class with the proxy server information
var options = url.parse(proxy);

var agent = new HttpsProxyAgent(options);

// finally, initiate the WebSocket connection
var socket = new WebSocket(endpoint, { agent: agent });

socket.on('open', function () {
  console.log('"open" event!');
  socket.send('hello world');
});

socket.on('message', function (data, flags) {
  console.log('"message" event! %j %j', data, flags);
  socket.close();
});
```

API
---

### new HttpsProxyAgent(Object options)

The `HttpsProxyAgent` class implements an `http.Agent` subclass that connects
to the specified "HTTP(s) proxy server" in order to proxy HTTPS and/or WebSocket
requests. This is achieved by using the [HTTP `CONNECT` method][CONNECT].

The `options` argument may either be a string URI of the proxy server to use, or an
"options" object with more specific properties:

  * `host` - String - Proxy host to connect to (may use `hostname` as well). Required.
  * `port` - Number - Proxy port to connect to. Required.
  * `protocol` - String - If `https:`, then use TLS to connect to the proxy.
  * `headers` - Object - Additional HTTP headers to be sent on the HTTP CONNECT method.
  * Any other options given are passed to the `net.connect()`/`tls.connect()` functions.

The following NPM package may be included in this product:

 - netmask@2.0.2

This package contains the following license and notice below:

Netmask
=======

The Netmask class parses and understands IPv4 CIDR blocks so they can be explored and compared. This module is highly inspired by Perl [Net::Netmask](http://search.cpan.org/dist/Net-Netmask/) module.

Synopsis
--------

```js
var Netmask = require('netmask').Netmask

var block = new Netmask('10.0.0.0/12');
block.base;                     // 10.0.0.0
block.mask;                     // 255.240.0.0
block.bitmask;                  // 12
block.hostmask;                 // 0.15.255.255
block.broadcast;                // 10.15.255.255
block.size;                     // 1048576
block.first;                    // 10.0.0.1
block.last;                     // 10.15.255.254

block.contains('10.0.8.10');    // true
block.contains('10.8.0.10');    // true
block.contains('192.168.1.20'); // false

block.forEach(function(ip, long, index));

block.next()                    // Netmask('10.16.0.0/12')
```

Constructing
------------

Netmask objects are created with an IP address and optionally a mask. There are many forms that are recognized:

```
'216.240.32.0/24'               // The preferred form.
'216.240.32.0/255.255.255.0'
'216.240.32.0', '255.255.255.0'
'216.240.32.0', 0xffffff00
'216.240.32.4'                  // A /32 block.
'0330.0360.040.04'              // Octal form
'0xd8.0xf0.0x20.0x4'            // Hex form
```

API
---

- `.base`: The base address of the network block as a string (eg: 216.240.32.0). Base does not give an indication of the size of the network block.
- `.mask`: The netmask as a string (eg: 255.255.255.0).
- `.hostmask`: The host mask which is the opposite of the netmask (eg: 0.0.0.255).
- `.bitmask`: The netmask as a number of bits in the network portion of the address for this block (eg: 24).
- `.size`: The number of IP addresses in a block (eg: 256).
- `.broadcast`: The blocks broadcast address (eg: 192.168.1.0/24 => 192.168.1.255)
- `.first`, `.last`: First and last useable address
- `.contains(ip or block)`: Returns a true if the IP number `ip` is part of the network. That is, a true value is returned if `ip` is between `base` and `broadcast`. If a Netmask object or a block is given, it returns true only of the given block fits inside the network.
- `.forEach(fn)`: Similar to the Array prototype method. It loops through all the useable addresses, ie between `first` and `last`.
- `.next(count)`: Without a `count`, return the next block of the same size after the current one. With a count, return the Nth block after the current one. A count of -1 returns the previous block. Undef will be returned if out of legal address space.
- `.toString()`: The netmask in base/bitmask format (e.g., '216.240.32.0/24')

Installation
------------

    $ npm install netmask

pac-proxy-agent
===============
### A [PAC file][pac-wikipedia] proxy `http.Agent` implementation for HTTP and HTTPS
[![Build Status](https://github.com/TooTallNate/node-pac-proxy-agent/workflows/Node%20CI/badge.svg)](https://github.com/TooTallNate/node-pac-proxy-agent/actions?workflow=Node+CI)

This module provides an `http.Agent` implementation that retreives the specified
[PAC proxy file][pac-wikipedia] and uses it to resolve which HTTP, HTTPS, or
SOCKS proxy, or if a direct connection should be used to connect to the
HTTP endpoint.

It is designed to be be used with the built-in `http` and `https` modules.


Installation
------------

Install with `npm`:

``` bash
$ npm install pac-proxy-agent
```


Example
-------

``` js
var url = require('url');
var http = require('http');
var PacProxyAgent = require('pac-proxy-agent');

// URI to a PAC proxy file to use (the "pac+" prefix is stripped)
var proxy = 'pac+https://cloudup.com/ceGH2yZ0Bjp+';
console.log('using PAC proxy proxy file at %j', proxy);

// HTTP endpoint for the proxy to connect to
var endpoint = 'http://nodejs.org/api/';
console.log('attempting to GET %j', endpoint);
var opts = url.parse(endpoint);

// create an instance of the `PacProxyAgent` class with the PAC file location
var agent = new PacProxyAgent(proxy);
opts.agent = agent;

http.get(opts, function (res) {
  console.log('"response" event!', res.headers);
  res.pipe(process.stdout);
});
```

The following NPM package may be included in this product:

 - pac-resolver@5.0.0

This package contains the following license and notice below:

pac-resolver
============
### Generates an asynchronous resolver function from a [PAC file][pac-wikipedia]
[![Build Status](https://github.com/TooTallNate/node-pac-resolver/workflows/Node%20CI/badge.svg)](https://github.com/TooTallNate/node-pac-resolver/actions?workflow=Node+CI)


This module accepts a JavaScript String of code, which is meant to be a
[PAC proxy file][pac-wikipedia], and returns a generated asynchronous
`FindProxyForURL()` function.


Installation
------------

Install with `npm`:

```bash
$ npm install pac-resolver
```


Example
-------

Given the PAC proxy file named `proxy.pac`:

```js
function FindProxyForURL(url, host) {
  if (isInNet(myIpAddress(), "10.1.10.0", "255.255.255.0")) {
    return "PROXY 1.2.3.4:8080";
  } else {
    return "DIRECT";
  }
}
```

You can consume this PAC file with `pac-resolver` like so:

```js
var fs = require('fs');
var pac = require('pac-resolver');

var FindProxyForURL = pac(fs.readFileSync('proxy.pac'));

FindProxyForURL('http://foo.com/').then((res) => {
  console.log(res);
  // "DIRECT"
});
```


API
---

### pac(String pacFileContents[, Object options]) → Function

Returns an asynchronous `FindProxyForURL()` function based off of the given JS
string `pacFileContents` PAC proxy file. An optional `options` object may be
passed in which respects the following options:

 * `filename` - String - the filename to use in error stack traces. Defaults to `proxy.pac`.
 * `sandbox` - Object - a map of functions to include in the sandbox of the
 JavaScript environment where the JS code will be executed. i.e. if you wanted to
 include the common `alert` function you could pass `alert: console.log`. For
 async functions, you must set the `async = true` property on the function
 instance, and the JS code will be able to invoke the function as if it were
 synchronous.

===========
### Maps proxy protocols to `http.Agent` implementations
[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/TooTallNate/node-proxy-agent.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/TooTallNate/node-proxy-agent)

This module provides a function that returns proxying `http.Agent` instances to
use based off of a given proxy URI. If no URI is provided, then
[proxy-from-env](https://www.npmjs.com/package/proxy-from-env) is used to get the URI
from `$HTTP_PROXY`, `$HTTPS_PROXY` and `$NO_PROXY` among others.

An LRU cache is used so that `http.Agent` instances are transparently re-used for
subsequent HTTP requests to the same proxy server.

The currently implemented protocol mappings are listed in the table below:


| Protocol   | Proxy Agent for `http` requests | Proxy Agent for `https` requests | Example
|:----------:|:-------------------------------:|:--------------------------------:|:--------:
| `http`     | [http-proxy-agent][]            | [https-proxy-agent][]            | `http://proxy-server-over-tcp.com:3128`
| `https`    | [http-proxy-agent][]            | [https-proxy-agent][]            | `https://proxy-server-over-tls.com:3129`
| `socks(v5)`| [socks-proxy-agent][]           | [socks-proxy-agent][]            | `socks://username:password@some-socks-proxy.com:9050` (username & password are optional)
| `socks5`   | [socks-proxy-agent][]           | [socks-proxy-agent][]            | `socks5://username:password@some-socks-proxy.com:9050` (username & password are optional)
| `socks4`   | [socks-proxy-agent][]           | [socks-proxy-agent][]            | `socks4://some-socks-proxy.com:9050`
| `pac`      | [pac-proxy-agent][]             | [pac-proxy-agent][]              | `pac+http://www.example.com/proxy.pac`


Installation
------------

Install with `npm`:

``` bash
$ npm install proxy-agent
```


Example
-------

``` js
var http = require('http');
var ProxyAgent = require('proxy-agent');

// HTTP, HTTPS, or SOCKS proxy to use
var proxyUri = process.env.http_proxy || 'http://168.63.43.102:3128';

var opts = {
  method: 'GET',
  host: 'jsonip.org',
  path: '/',
  // this is the important part!
  // If no proxyUri is specified, then https://www.npmjs.com/package/proxy-from-env
  // is used to get the proxyUri.
  agent: new ProxyAgent(proxyUri)
};

// the rest works just like any other normal HTTP request
http.get(opts, onresponse);

function onresponse (res) {
  console.log(res.statusCode, res.headers);
  res.pipe(process.stdout);
}
```


API
---

### new ProxyAgent(Object|String opts|uri)

Returns an `http.Agent` instance based off of the given proxy `opts` or URI
string. An LRU cache is used, so the same `http.Agent` instance will be
returned if identical args are passed in.

# Sinch RTC SDK - JavaScript

## Setting Up the Development Environment

Build tools are installed using [Nix](https://nixos.org/download.html) package manager. To install a local devenv, run:

    make devenv

In the root of this repository run:

    make sync

This will

- Sync git submodules.
- Set up npm environment [https://www.npmjs.com/]

When the script finishes, it should be possible to run.

    make serve

this will build the sdk and start a local http server on port 5050 if everything works you should be able to load [http://localhost:5050/reference-apps/javascript/samples/]

## Build and Test Sdk

### Build

    make build

### Generate ocra api from ocra design

    make ocra

### Build and start local http server

    make serve

### Tests

    make test

### Create the jssdk package

    make dist

## E2E Smoke test

### Build Sdk for E2E smoke test

    make bidiro

### Build and start local host for running test host app

    make bidiro-serve

This will start a local webserver at port 1080 and a WebSocket proxy listening on port 3000. To run the test host app use http://localhost:1080/sinch/{channel}/?sdk={sdk}

{channel} is an identifier for the channel and can be any string. WebSocket message to this app should be sent to http://{host}:3000/bidiro/{channel}

{sdk} is the folder where the sdk is located. By defaulr {sdk} is "sdk" which is the folder where the local built (make bidiro) sdk is located.

### Running E2E Tests inside docker locally

`npm run e2e`

## Prerequisites

1. Make sure you have cloned the [E2E repository](https://git.clxnetworks.net/rtc/client-sdk/rtc-sdk-e2e-test) in your home directory
2. The JS sdk and E2E respository are in the same parent directory
3. Docker or [Docker Desktop](https://www.docker.com/products/docker-desktop/) is installed on your machine

### Design

For design document, see [design/README.md](design/README.md)

The following NPM package may be included in this product:

 - socks-proxy-agent@5.0.1

This package contains the following license and notice below:

socks-proxy-agent
================
### A SOCKS proxy `http.Agent` implementation for HTTP and HTTPS
[![Build Status](https://github.com/TooTallNate/node-socks-proxy-agent/workflows/Node%20CI/badge.svg)](https://github.com/TooTallNate/node-socks-proxy-agent/actions?workflow=Node+CI)

This module provides an `http.Agent` implementation that connects to a
specified SOCKS proxy server, and can be used with the built-in `http`
and `https` modules.

It can also be used in conjunction with the `ws` module to establish a WebSocket
connection over a SOCKS proxy. See the "Examples" section below.

Installation
------------

Install with `npm`:

``` bash
$ npm install socks-proxy-agent
```


Examples
--------

#### TypeScript example

```ts
import https from 'https';
import { SocksProxyAgent } from 'socks-proxy-agent';

const info = {
	host: 'br41.nordvpn.com',
	userId: 'your-name@gmail.com',
	password: 'abcdef12345124'
};
const agent = new SocksProxyAgent(info);

https.get('https://jsonip.org', { agent }, (res) => {
	console.log(res.headers);
	res.pipe(process.stdout);
});
```

#### `http` module example

```js
var url = require('url');
var http = require('http');
var SocksProxyAgent = require('socks-proxy-agent');

// SOCKS proxy to connect to
var proxy = process.env.socks_proxy || 'socks://127.0.0.1:1080';
console.log('using proxy server %j', proxy);

// HTTP endpoint for the proxy to connect to
var endpoint = process.argv[2] || 'http://nodejs.org/api/';
console.log('attempting to GET %j', endpoint);
var opts = url.parse(endpoint);

// create an instance of the `SocksProxyAgent` class with the proxy server information
var agent = new SocksProxyAgent(proxy);
opts.agent = agent;

http.get(opts, function (res) {
	console.log('"response" event!', res.headers);
	res.pipe(process.stdout);
});
```

#### `https` module example

```js
var url = require('url');
var https = require('https');
var SocksProxyAgent = require('socks-proxy-agent');

// SOCKS proxy to connect to
var proxy = process.env.socks_proxy || 'socks://127.0.0.1:1080';
console.log('using proxy server %j', proxy);

// HTTP endpoint for the proxy to connect to
var endpoint = process.argv[2] || 'https://encrypted.google.com/';
console.log('attempting to GET %j', endpoint);
var opts = url.parse(endpoint);

// create an instance of the `SocksProxyAgent` class with the proxy server information
var agent = new SocksProxyAgent(proxy);
opts.agent = agent;

https.get(opts, function (res) {
	console.log('"response" event!', res.headers);
	res.pipe(process.stdout);
});
```

#### `ws` WebSocket connection example

``` js
var WebSocket = require('ws');
var SocksProxyAgent = require('socks-proxy-agent');

// SOCKS proxy to connect to
var proxy = process.env.socks_proxy || 'socks://127.0.0.1:1080';
console.log('using proxy server %j', proxy);

// WebSocket endpoint for the proxy to connect to
var endpoint = process.argv[2] || 'ws://echo.websocket.org';
console.log('attempting to connect to WebSocket %j', endpoint);

// create an instance of the `SocksProxyAgent` class with the proxy server information
var agent = new SocksProxyAgent(proxy);

// initiate the WebSocket connection
var socket = new WebSocket(endpoint, { agent: agent });

socket.on('open', function () {
	console.log('"open" event!');
	socket.send('hello world');
});

socket.on('message', function (data, flags) {
	console.log('"message" event! %j %j', data, flags);
	socket.close();
});
```

The following NPM package may be included in this product:

 - superagent-proxy@3.0.0

This package contains the following license and notice below:

superagent-proxy
================
### `Request#proxy(uri)` superagent extension

This module extends [`superagent`][superagent]'s `Request` class with
a `.proxy(uri)` function. This allows you to proxy the HTTP request through a
proxy of some kind.

It is backed by the [`proxy-agent`][proxy-agent] module, so see
[its README for more details][proxy-agent-readme].


Installation
------------

Install with `npm`:

``` bash
$ npm install superagent-proxy
```


Example
-------

``` js
var request = require('superagent');

// extend with Request#proxy()
require('superagent-proxy')(request);

// HTTP, HTTPS, or SOCKS proxy to use
var proxy = process.env.http_proxy || 'http://168.63.43.102:3128';

request
  .get(process.argv[2] || 'https://encrypted.google.com/')
  .proxy(proxy)
  .end(onresponse);

function onresponse (err, res) {
  if (err) {
    console.log(err);
  } else {
    console.log(res.status, res.headers);
    console.log(res.body);
  }
}
```

The following NPM package may be included in this product:

 - xregexp@2.0.0

This package contains the following license and notice below:

[XRegExp](http://xregexp.com/)
==============================

XRegExp provides augmented, extensible, cross-browser JavaScript regular expressions. You get new syntax and flags beyond what browsers support natively, along with a collection of utils to make your client-side grepping and parsing easier. XRegExp also frees you from worrying about pesky inconsistencies in cross-browser regex handling and the dubious `lastIndex` property.

XRegExp supports all native ES5 regular expression syntax. It's about 3.5 KB when minified and gzipped. It works with Internet Explorer 5.5+, Firefox 1.5+, Chrome, Safari 3+, and Opera 9.5+.


## Performance

XRegExp regular expressions compile to native RegExp objects, thus there is no performance difference when using XRegExp objects with native methods. There is a small performance cost when *compiling* XRegExps. If you want, however, you can use `XRegExp.cache` to avoid ever incurring the compilation cost for a given pattern more than once. Doing so can even lead to XRegExp being faster than native regexes in synthetic tests that repeatedly compile the same regex.


## Usage examples

~~~ js
// Using named capture and flag x (free-spacing and line comments)
var date = XRegExp('(?<year>  [0-9]{4}) -?  # year  \n\
                    (?<month> [0-9]{2}) -?  # month \n\
                    (?<day>   [0-9]{2})     # day   ', 'x');

// XRegExp.exec gives you named backreferences on the match result
var match = XRegExp.exec('2012-02-22', date);
match.day; // -> '22'

// It also includes optional pos and sticky arguments
var pos = 3, result = [];
while (match = XRegExp.exec('<1><2><3><4>5<6>', /<(\d+)>/, pos, 'sticky')) {
    result.push(match[1]);
    pos = match.index + match[0].length;
} // result -> ['2', '3', '4']

// XRegExp.replace allows named backreferences in replacements
XRegExp.replace('2012-02-22', date, '${month}/${day}/${year}'); // -> '02/22/2012'
XRegExp.replace('2012-02-22', date, function (match) {
    return match.month + '/' + match.day + '/' + match.year;
}); // -> '02/22/2012'

// In fact, all XRegExps are RegExps and work perfectly with native methods
date.test('2012-02-22'); // -> true

// The *only* caveat is that named captures must be referred to using numbered backreferences
'2012-02-22'.replace(date, '$2/$3/$1'); // -> '02/22/2012'

// If you want, you can extend native methods so you don't have to worry about this
// Doing so also fixes numerous browser bugs in the native methods
XRegExp.install('natives');
'2012-02-22'.replace(date, '${month}/${day}/${year}'); // -> '02/22/2012'
'2012-02-22'.replace(date, function (match) {
    return match.month + '/' + match.day + '/' + match.year;
}); // -> '02/22/2012'
date.exec('2012-02-22').day; // -> '22'

// Extract every other digit from a string using XRegExp.forEach
XRegExp.forEach('1a2345', /\d/, function (match, i) {
    if (i % 2) this.push(+match[0]);
}, []); // -> [2, 4]

// Get numbers within <b> tags using XRegExp.matchChain
XRegExp.matchChain('1 <b>2</b> 3 <b>4 a 56</b>', [
    XRegExp('(?is)<b>.*?</b>'),
    /\d+/
]); // -> ['2', '4', '56']

// You can also pass forward and return specific backreferences
var html = '<a href="http://xregexp.com/">XRegExp</a>\
            <a href="http://www.google.com/">Google</a>';
XRegExp.matchChain(html, [
    {regex: /<a href="([^"]+)">/i, backref: 1},
    {regex: XRegExp('(?i)^https?://(?<domain>[^/?#]+)'), backref: 'domain'}
]); // -> ['xregexp.com', 'www.google.com']

// XRegExp.union safely merges strings and regexes into a single pattern
XRegExp.union(['a+b*c', /(dogs)\1/, /(cats)\1/], 'i');
// -> /a\+b\*c|(dogs)\1|(cats)\2/i
~~~

These examples should give you the flavor of what's possible, but XRegExp has more syntax, flags, utils, options, and browser fixes that aren't shown here. You can even augment XRegExp's regular expression syntax with addons (see below) or write your own. See [xregexp.com](http://xregexp.com/) for more details.


## Addons

In browsers, you can either load addons individually, or bundle all addons together with XRegExp by loading `xregexp-all.js`. XRegExp's [npm](http://npmjs.org/) package uses `xregexp-all.js`, which means that the addons are always available when XRegExp is installed on the server using npm.


### XRegExp Unicode Base

In browsers, first include the Unicode Base script:

~~~ html
<script src="xregexp.js"></script>
<script src="addons/unicode/unicode-base.js"></script>
~~~

Then you can do this:

~~~ js
var unicodeWord = XRegExp('^\\p{L}+$');
unicodeWord.test('Русский'); // -> true
unicodeWord.test('日本語'); // -> true
unicodeWord.test('العربية'); // -> true
~~~

The base script adds `\p{Letter}` and its alias `\p{L}`, but other Unicode categories, scripts, blocks, and properties require addon packages. Try these next examples after additionally including `unicode-scripts.js`:

~~~ js
XRegExp('^\\p{Hiragana}+$').test('ひらがな'); // -> true
XRegExp('^[\\p{Latin}\\p{Common}]+$').test('Über Café.'); // -> true
~~~

XRegExp uses the Unicode 6.1 Basic Multilingual Plane.


### XRegExp.build

In browsers, first include the script:

~~~ html
<script src="xregexp.js"></script>
<script src="addons/build.js"></script>
~~~

You can then build regular expressions using named subpatterns, for readability and pattern reuse:

~~~ js
var time = XRegExp.build('(?x)^ {{hours}} ({{minutes}}) $', {
    hours: XRegExp.build('{{h12}} : | {{h24}}', {
        h12: /1[0-2]|0?[1-9]/,
        h24: /2[0-3]|[01][0-9]/
    }, 'x'),
    minutes: /^[0-5][0-9]$/
});

time.test('10:59'); // -> true
XRegExp.exec('10:59', time).minutes; // -> '59'
~~~

Named subpatterns can be provided as strings or regex objects. A leading `^` and trailing unescaped `$` are stripped from subpatterns if both are present, which allows embedding independently useful anchored patterns. `{{…}}` tokens can be quantified as a single unit. Backreferences in the outer pattern and provided subpatterns are automatically renumbered to work correctly within the larger combined pattern. The syntax `({{name}})` works as shorthand for named capture via `(?<name>{{name}})`. Named subpatterns cannot be embedded within character classes.

See also: *[Creating Grammatical Regexes Using XRegExp.build](http://blog.stevenlevithan.com/archives/grammatical-patterns-xregexp-build)*.


### XRegExp.matchRecursive

In browsers, first include the script:

~~~ html
<script src="xregexp.js"></script>
<script src="addons/matchrecursive.js"></script>
~~~

You can then match recursive constructs using XRegExp pattern strings as left and right delimiters:

~~~ js
var str = '(t((e))s)t()(ing)';
XRegExp.matchRecursive(str, '\\(', '\\)', 'g');
// -> ['t((e))s', '', 'ing']

// Extended information mode with valueNames
str = 'Here is <div> <div>an</div></div> example';
XRegExp.matchRecursive(str, '<div\\s*>', '</div>', 'gi', {
    valueNames: ['between', 'left', 'match', 'right']
});
/* -> [
{name: 'between', value: 'Here is ',       start: 0,  end: 8},
{name: 'left',    value: '<div>',          start: 8,  end: 13},
{name: 'match',   value: ' <div>an</div>', start: 13, end: 27},
{name: 'right',   value: '</div>',         start: 27, end: 33},
{name: 'between', value: ' example',       start: 33, end: 41}
] */

// Omitting unneeded parts with null valueNames, and using escapeChar
str = '...{1}\\{{function(x,y){return y+x;}}';
XRegExp.matchRecursive(str, '{', '}', 'g', {
    valueNames: ['literal', null, 'value', null],
    escapeChar: '\\'
});
/* -> [
{name: 'literal', value: '...', start: 0, end: 3},
{name: 'value',   value: '1',   start: 4, end: 5},
{name: 'literal', value: '\\{', start: 6, end: 8},
{name: 'value',   value: 'function(x,y){return y+x;}', start: 9, end: 35}
] */

// Sticky mode via flag y
str = '<1><<<2>>><3>4<5>';
XRegExp.matchRecursive(str, '<', '>', 'gy');
// -> ['1', '<<2>>', '3']
~~~

`XRegExp.matchRecursive` throws an error if it sees an unbalanced delimiter in the target string.


### XRegExp Prototype Methods

In browsers, first include the script:

~~~ html
<script src="xregexp.js"></script>
<script src="addons/prototypes.js"></script>
~~~

New XRegExp regexes then gain a collection of useful methods: `apply`, `call`, `forEach`, `globalize`, `xexec`, and `xtest`.

~~~ js
// To demonstrate the call method, let's first create the function we'll be using...
function filter(array, fn) {
    var res = [];
    array.forEach(function (el) {if (fn.call(null, el)) res.push(el);});
    return res;
}
// Now we can filter arrays using functions and regexes
filter(['a', 'ba', 'ab', 'b'], XRegExp('^a')); // -> ['a', 'ab']
~~~

Native `RegExp` objects copied by `XRegExp` are augmented with any `XRegExp.prototype` methods. The following lines therefore work equivalently:

~~~ js
XRegExp('[a-z]', 'ig').xexec('abc');
XRegExp(/[a-z]/ig).xexec('abc');
XRegExp.globalize(/[a-z]/i).xexec('abc');
~~~


## Installation and usage

In browsers:

~~~ html
<script src="xregexp-min.js"></script>
~~~

Or, to bundle XRegExp with all of its addons:

~~~ html
<script src="xregexp-all-min.js"></script>
~~~

Using [npm](http://npmjs.org/):

~~~ bash
npm install xregexp
~~~

In [Node.js](http://nodejs.org/) and [CommonJS module](http://wiki.commonjs.org/wiki/Modules) loaders:

~~~ js
var XRegExp = require('xregexp').XRegExp;
~~~


### Running tests on the server with npm

~~~ bash
npm install -g qunit  # needed to run the tests
npm test  # in the xregexp root
~~~

If XRegExp was not installed using npm, just open `tests/index.html` in your browser.
